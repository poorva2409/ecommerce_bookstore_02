üìö E-Commerce Bookstore ‚Äî Source Code Management Project

About the E-Commerce Bookstore

The E-Commerce Bookstore is a web-based platform designed to provide a smooth and user-friendly online book shopping experience. It allows customers to browse different book categories, view featured titles, access special offers, add books to their cart, and proceed to login or checkout.

This project was developed as part of a Source Code Management (SCM) group assignment to demonstrate:
	‚Ä¢	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding skills
	‚Ä¢	Git branching, committing, and merging
	‚Ä¢	Team collaboration on a shared codebase

The repository contains separate contributions from each team member, merged into the final main branch after completing the required 4 branches and 20 commits per member.
